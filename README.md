# RecycleView
Quickly classify items you're throwing away into trash or recycling categories, effectively minimizing waste and time wasted deciding which bin to throw the item in.

# Inspiration
Inspired by the times we've been stuck deciding what's recyclable in today's consumerist society. Effectively streamlining that process to lead to environment-oriented practices with a quick model to determine how to classify the item, so we don't have to.

# What it does
Takes in an image input of the item on an online platform, processing in backend by our model and outputs a class designating how recyclable it is.

# How we built it
Frontend built in Vue, connected to backend through flask. The model is built with PyTorch in Google Colab. The minigame is built with micropython on an ESP32
